# Ideas

## To do

- add more themes
- add more page designs
- add `deck init`
- add `deck start`
- add new demo deck
- more configurable, add `--output` or `--src` or `--theme` flags, right now the default is equivalent

```terminal
$ deck export --src ./decks --output ./docs --theme basic
```

- guideline of creating sharable themes
- launch on product hunt
- improve whole page refrech and better support fullscreen
- make it simple and reduce bundle size
